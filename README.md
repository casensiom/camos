# CamOS
📝 Simple operating sistem from stcratch.

## Why

📚 This is an experiment to know how an OS works, is not intended to be a real OS.

Don't even pretend to use the correct concept names 😜

❤️ It's mainly following this document: [os-dev.pdf](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)

## Tools 

🧩 Use Make to build and execute the kernel.

🛠 Use NASM to build the kernel.

🚀 Use QEMU to launch the kernel.
